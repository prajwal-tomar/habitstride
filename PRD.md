## User Experience

### Onboarding Flow:
1. User signs up via Next.js/Supabase Auth.
2. User sets up a profile: selects habits, sets preferences like reminder times, and chooses notification types.
3. The dashboard immediately displays a streak counter, a color-coded habit grid, and options to check in for the day.

### Daily Check-in Flow:
- Users open the app or receive a notification reminder.
- They check off habits for the day, which updates the color-coded habit grid.

### Habit Progress Flow:
- Users can view detailed stats (streaks, badges earned, and completion rate).
- Habit trends and analytics show long-term performance (via graphs and charts).

### Motivational Elements:
- Users earn badges when they hit specific milestones (e.g., 7-day streak, 30 habits completed).
- Streak tracking keeps users focused, while personalized insights from GPT-4 keep them engaged with relevant advice and feedback.

## Narrative
Imagine you're trying to build a daily meditation habit. With HabitStride, you can easily set up a reminder to meditate each morning. The habit grid turns green for each day you check in, and after a week of consistency, you’re rewarded with a streak badge. 

One day, you’re curious why your streak ended abruptly last month, so you review your habit analytics and see a clear chart showing your meditation trends. Based on your data, GPT-4 suggests that your streak was interrupted on weekends due to a shift in your schedule and recommends setting different reminder times for weekends. With these insights, you adjust your habit, quickly get back on track, and keep your streak going for months.
