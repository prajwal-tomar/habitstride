## Design Principles

For HabitStride, the design principles should focus on creating a calm, positive, and motivating environment that encourages users to stay consistent with their habits while feeling supported. The tone of the app is encouraging yet soothing, guiding users with a friendly and uplifting voice that acknowledges effort and progress.

Color Palette:
* Use a calming gradient background that transitions from soft coral to a light pastel orange, invoking feelings of positivity and warmth. This gradient serves as the foundation of the design, creating a relaxed yet energized atmosphere.
* Accents of light green or soft blue can be used for highlighting key interactions such as completed habits, buttons, and notifications to promote a sense of achievement and encouragement.
* Subtle shades of light gray and off-white for text and dividers to maintain a clean, minimalistic look while keeping the focus on key visual elements like the habit grid and badges.

Design Principles:
* Minimalistic and Focused: The UI should be free of distractions, with clear sections that guide users through their habit journey. Keep the interface simple, using clean lines and intuitive design.
* Habit Grid Visualization: The GitHub-like grid should reflect users' daily habit completions with a soothing color scheme—greens for success, yellows for partial completion, and subtle pinks for missed days. This reinforces a sense of growth and progression.
* Typography: Use sans-serif fonts that are easy to read and modern, with headings slightly bold to draw attention to key sections. Keep the text spacing relaxed to complement the calming vibe of the color palette.
* Encouraging Tone: The copy should be gentle but motivational, with reminders phrased like “You're doing great!” or “Keep up the good work!” to instill a sense of accomplishment, even for small wins.
This combination of soft gradients and warm, positive tones will help HabitStride users feel motivated and calm as they build new habits.# habitstride
